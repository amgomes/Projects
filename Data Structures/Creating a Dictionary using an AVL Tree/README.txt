HW #5 - SpellChecker

This program utilizes the following files:
  AVLTree.h
  AVLTree.cpp
  CommandLineParser.h
  CommandLineParser.cpp
  DoubleLinkedList.h
  DoubleLinkedList.cpp
  ScriptParser.h
  ScriptParser.cpp
  SpellChecker.cpp - Main Function

This program reads and stores a dictionary. It then reads in one or more input files
and performs operations specified in a script file. 
These instructions include:
 - reading from a file and creating a linked list of the words inside.
 - creating a union of two lists
 - creating an intersection of two lists
 - writing a list to an output file
 - writing a list to an output file in reverse
 - checking to see which words from an input file exist in a dictionary
   and outputting those words into a separate list

This program uses an AVL Tree to store the dictionary and merge sort to keep the
input files sorted.
